    <h1>Procedural Programming</h1>
    <p>Our new credit is called Procedural Programming. A procedure is more commonly known as a FUNCTION. Other similar
      structures include include subroutine, METHOD, subtask, etc. Technically some of these terms have slightly
      different meanings but we will treat them all as synonyms.</p>
    <h2>No More Global Variables?</h2>
    <p>As your programs grow in complexity, you will move towards having hundreds of variables. This means that we will
      need
      to move our understanding away from Global Variables and towards variables with LOCAL SCOPE. Variables have a LOCA
      if they are created (using LET or VAR) within a function. That means they are ___ ___ in any other function. This
      is a problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Functions with Parameters</h2>
    <p>If a variable can only be accessed within the function it is created, how can we use that data in another
      function?
      We create a function that accepts a PARAMETER. This means we can pass that___ into the function to use there.</p>

    <h2>Functions with Return Values</h2>
    <p>Sometimes a function creates or changes data that you want to send BACK somewhere else. This is done using
      something
      called a RETURN value.</p>

    <h2>2 Ways to Declare a Function</h2>
    <p>let functionname = function(){ }; </p>
    <p>function functionName(){ }</p>

    <h2>The Problem with P5.js</h2>
    <p>As we said above, the goal is to reduce or eliminate global variables and instead pass needed data into or out of
      functions using parameters and return values. However, we are using P5.js. That means we can not write all the
      functions the way we want. </p>
    <p>Functions such as draw(), setup(), etc. are prewritten and they do NOT accept extra data as parameters. Therefore
      there will be times when we need to make some variables global. This is not ideal as it confuses the learning
      goals of some activities. </p>
    <p>Remember that the key concept of this credit is to learn how to use parameters and return values. Therefore you
      must follow the assignment instructions carefully. Do not use any global variables except where specifically
      directed or you will not fulfill the requirements of our assignments, even if it appears to work properly. </p>
